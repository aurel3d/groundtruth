# Brainstorming Session Results

**Facilitator:** Aurel
**Date:** 2026-01-13

## Session Overview

**Topic:** Feature ideas for the claims analysis process in a community-driven fact-checking platform

**Goals:** Generate innovative ideas for how claims can be analyzed, evaluated, and judged more effectively by the community

### Session Setup

We're exploring the claims analysis workflow for a fact-checking platform where users submit claims and the community evaluates their truthfulness. The focus is on discovering innovative features that can enhance how claims are processed, analyzed, and judged by the community.

## Technique Selection

**Approach:** Progressive Technique Flow
**Journey Design:** Systematic development from exploration to action

**Progressive Techniques:**

- **Phase 1 - Exploration:** SCAMPER Method for maximum idea generation across seven systematic lenses
- **Phase 2 - Pattern Recognition:** Mind Mapping for organizing insights and discovering connections
- **Phase 3 - Development:** Five Whys for refining concepts and understanding root value
- **Phase 4 - Action Planning:** Decision Tree Mapping for implementation planning and pathways

**Journey Rationale:** This progressive flow takes us from broad systematic exploration of feature possibilities through visual organization, deep refinement, and finally to concrete implementation planning - perfect for comprehensive claims analysis feature development.

## Phase 1: Expansive Exploration - SCAMPER Method

**Technique Completed:** SCAMPER Method (All 7 lenses)
**Ideas Generated:** 120+
**Energy Level:** High, systematic, boundary-expanding
**Key Discovery:** "All-in-One" platform positioning - multi-factor judgment with Lie Hunter gamification

### SCAMPER Exploration Summary

#### S - SUBSTITUTE (Ideas #1-7)
Key concepts explored:
- AI-Expert-Community weighted truth scoring with transparency
- Multi-format evidence (text, image, video, link) with strength ratings
- Verification badges and reputation systems
- Transparent judgment marketplace where judges build public credibility
- Radical transparency instead of hidden moderation
- Accountability voting with automatic weight adjustments
- Live debate threads replacing static verdicts

**Breakthrough insight:** Users want radical transparency - show expert vs community disagreement openly, let people judge for themselves.

#### C - COMBINE (Ideas #8-19)
Key concepts explored:
- Claims + historical claim tracking ("Has this been claimed before?")
- Evidence + OSINT tools (reverse image search, metadata extraction, geolocation)
- Community voting + bot detection and analysis
- Expert verification + AI research assistants
- Fact-checking + crowdsourced investigation tasks
- Truth ratings + real-time news feed integration
- Prediction markets + community judgment

**Breakthrough insight:** OSINT integration provides intelligence-grade verification automatically for all submitted evidence.

#### A - ADAPT (Ideas #20-45)
Key concepts explored:
- Academic peer review processes adapted for claims
- Credit score models creating "Truth Scores" for users
- RPG leveling systems (Novice → Expert → Master → Truth Guardian)
- Achievement systems (badges for milestones)
- Battle pass / season systems for recurring engagement
- MMO guild systems for team-based fact-checking
- Daily quests and missions for habit formation
- **AMONG US ADAPTATION** - Lie Hunter mode for detecting imposters and coordinated misinformation

**MAJOR BREAKTHROUGH:** Gamification emerged as core design philosophy. Two distinct modes identified:
1. **Truth Seekers** (constructive verification)
2. **Lie Hunters** (adversarial detection - Among Us style imposter hunting)

#### M - MODIFY (Ideas #46-69)
Key concepts explored:
- Real-time streaming verification (watch investigations live)
- Micro-claims vs mega-claims (breaking complex statements into verifiable pieces)
- Visual truth intensity (glow effects based on confidence)
- Time-locked voting to prevent bandwagon effects
- Voice-based evidence submissions
- Claim complexity ratings (1-5 stars difficulty)
- Variable reward multipliers for urgent/important claims
- Lie Hunter pattern detection overlays and special tools

**CRITICAL INSIGHT:** "There is no central platform for fact-checking with multi-factor judgment and multiple scores" - This is the unique value proposition. The platform is "ALL IN ONE."

#### P - PUT TO OTHER USES (Ideas #70-80)
Key concepts explored:
- Research paper verification (combat replication crisis)
- Product review authenticity (detect fake reviews)
- Legal evidence verification (crowdsourced legal investigation)
- Historical fact database
- Medical claim verification (combat health misinformation)
- Education / critical thinking training tool
- Journalism fact-checking backend (B2B for newsrooms)
- Political debate real-time referee

**Insight:** Multi-factor verification system has applications far beyond political fact-checking.

#### E - ELIMINATE (Ideas #81-103)
Key concepts explored:
- Eliminate account requirements (Wikipedia-style openness)
- Eliminate manual claim submission (auto-scrape trending topics)
- Eliminate binary voting (force confidence intervals)
- Eliminate permanent bans (rehabilitation over punishment)
- Eliminate comment sections (structured contribution only)
- Eliminate complex onboarding (instant engagement)
- Eliminate desktop-only design (mobile-first)
- Eliminate expert gatekeeping (meritocracy through track record)

**CORE DESIGN PRINCIPLES IDENTIFIED:**
1. **Eliminate elitism** - Must be accessible and trusted by all
2. **Eliminate multi-step workflows** - Simplify to 1-3 clicks
3. **Eliminate time commitment barriers** - Enable micro-contributions (30 seconds to 5 minutes)
4. **Cannot eliminate truth scores** - They are the core value proposition

#### R - REVERSE / REARRANGE (Ideas #104-120)
Key concepts explored:
- Evidence first, claims second (start with facts, derive claims)
- Novices judge first, experts only on controversies (efficient expert time)
- Burden of proof on claimer (must submit evidence with claim)
- Hide results until you vote (force independent thinking)
- Vote on evidence quality, not claim truth (truth emerges from evidence)
- Reward changing your mind (incentivize intellectual humility)
- Claims come to users (AI routes to best verifiers)
- Simple first, complexity on-demand (progressive disclosure)

**Design insight:** Solve "too many steps" problem with layered complexity - casual users see simplicity, power users access depth.

### Session Highlights

**Creative Strengths Demonstrated:**
- Exceptional energy and enthusiasm throughout all 7 SCAMPER lenses
- Strong vision for "all-in-one" platform positioning
- Deep engagement with gamification concepts, especially Lie Hunters
- Clear understanding of core values: transparency, accessibility, non-elitism
- Excellent collaborative building on ideas

**Key Breakthrough Moments:**
1. **Multi-factor weighted truth scoring** with radical transparency (S lens)
2. **Lie Hunters mode** - Among Us style imposter detection (A lens)
3. **Gamification as core philosophy** - making fact-checking fun (A lens)
4. **"All in one" positioning** - the gap in the market (M lens)
5. **Accessibility principles** - eliminate elitism, steps, time barriers (E lens)

**Thematic Clusters Emerging:**
- **Transparency & Trust:** Radical openness, multiple scores, show disagreements
- **Gamification & Engagement:** RPG systems, achievements, Lie Hunters, guilds
- **Multi-Factor Verification:** AI + experts + community + OSINT combined
- **Accessibility:** Simple UX, micro-contributions, mobile-first, no gatekeeping
- **Detective/Hunter Mechanics:** Pattern detection, bot hunting, imposter catching
- **Evidence Quality:** OSINT tools, multi-source requirements, strength scoring
- **Social & Collaborative:** Guilds, following trusted users, team-based hunting

### Energy and Momentum

- Lie Hunter gameplay mechanics
- Multi-factor scoring transparency
- Gamification potential
- Platform accessibility and simplicity

**Total Duration:** ~90 minutes of active ideation
**Idea Velocity:** ~1.3 ideas per minute average
**Engagement:** Sustained high energy, excellent collaboration
